How long did you spend working on this project?
About 60 to 90 minutes

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I was able to edit the variable of another class by accessing it from a method of a different class, this concept was completly new to me.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
I added additional features to show when the stock is empty and another to show when the stock is low to trigger a warning.
These messages will pop up only when the stock is actually low or empty and will other wise display no messages so that no confusion is caused.

Where do you still have room to grow?
The purchase order can be made user interactive. So that use gets a menu of toys and price, they can then choose toy and quantity, the system will then check the stock and if available ship it.
